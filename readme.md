# Frontend practice with catalog page and hovers

- [DEMO LINK](https://lanebx.github.io/layout_catalog_hovers/)

## The task

- Make all the changes smooth on hover
- Smoothly (during 300ms) increase the card by 20 percent on hover (neighboring cards **should not be** affected)
- Smoothly (during 300ms) change card title text color to `#34568b`
  - `:hover` should be applied only to the card, do not add it to the title directly
- Smoothly (during 300ms) change navigation link text color to `#00acdc`
